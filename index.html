          Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.
          Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats
          throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the
          continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large
          bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five
          nonretractile
          claws, and short tails.

          The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
          terrestrial
          animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa
          camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant
          species
          due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual species can be distinguished by
          their
          fur coat patterns. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.

        <p>
          The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
          broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is
          sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social
          species,
          forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups
          of
          female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex
          and
          keystone predator.

        <p>
          Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians.
          Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus
          monkeys,
          in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on
          cladistics,
          apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope.

        <p>
          An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae in
          the order Crocodilia. The two extant species are the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and the Chinese
          alligator (A. sinensis). Additionally, several extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains.
          Alligators first appeared during the late Eocene epoch about 37 million years ago.[1]
